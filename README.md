Hi, I’m **Yusra Fayyaz** — a statistics expert with a strong interest in data analysis and machine learning. I enjoy working on statistical projects that turn complex data into meaningful insights.  
I have hands-on experience with R, Python, Stata, Minitab, SPSS, Jamovi, Weka, Tableau, and Power BI, which allows me to work across a range of data tasks from statistical modeling to visualization.
Right now, I’m also expanding my skill set by learning frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to build a more versatile portfolio.  
I’m open to collaborating on data science projects where I can apply and grow my analytical skills.  
You can reach me at **yusrafiaz1@gmail.com** or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusra-fayyaz-statistics).
